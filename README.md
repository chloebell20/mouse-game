THE MOUSE GAME

Description of Game Code
Our Mouse game has components that will appear on both the VGA Display and the HEX display. It takes input from the user through the PS/2 Keyboard and Push buttons.
How to View the Game
Once the code is compiled, press continue to load the game. A start page will be displayed on the VGA pixel buffer. All key information to play the game is displayed there.
Objective of the Game:
The goal of the game is to escape the mouse traps that are coming towards the mouse by moving the mouse up and down. Be careful, the more traps you escape the faster they come at you!
Instruction to Operate Game:

To start the game, press any Push Button
Start pressing in the PS/2 Keyboard to move the mouse (the up key on your keyboard will move the mouse upwards and vice versa for downwards) as a trap will start coming towards you.
As you escape the mouse traps, your score increases. You will see that change on the Hex Display.
If a mouse trap touches you, you lose and the game will stop. A "Game Over" screen will appear and give you directions to start again.
To start playing again, press any push button to restart the game. Then repeat the steps from step 2 to play all over again.
Good luck and hope you have as much fun playing the game as we had creating it!
